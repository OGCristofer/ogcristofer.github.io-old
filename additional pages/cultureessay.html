    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    <p>
      I am Hounduran and Mexican, but I am diffrent from my ancestors.
      Traditional Hondurans/Mexicans are people who
      <ul>
        <li>Speak Spanish</li>
        <li>Know how to make Baleadas/Tamales</li>
        <li>Also, some people kill animals for food when they live in farms</li>
      </ul>
      But, I am a modern Honduran/Mexican living in the United States, and
      sometimes I feel strange in this country. Although I am Honduran/Mexican,
      I don't
      <ul>
        <li>Kill animals for food, but people who live in ranches or farms do.</li>
        <li>Know what it's like to make tamales</li>
      </ul>
      </p>

    <h1>Body Paragraph One</h1>
    <p>
      <em>Here in the U.S., there are many people who speak spanish natively.</em>
      <br> The
      U.S. is home to <em>Millions</em> of hispanics. All these hispanics go
      losing their native language, bit-by-bit. This happens because of
      them only speaking english. <br>
      In Mexico, no one speaks English.
      In Mexico, no one speaks English, usually, and Spanish is the native
      language. In Mexico, <em>*mostly* everyone</em> speaks Spanish and is able to
      understand each other, contrary to here where <em>everyone</em> speaks
      different languages.
    </p>
    <h1>Body Paragraph 2</h1>
    <p>
      <em>Tamales, it's all diffrent here in the U.S.</em> <br>Here in the U.S,
      we don't make our tamales at home. We usually do at my house, but most of
      the other people don't. They buy them at stores, for they do not remember
      how to cook them. Others go to restraunts and buy them there. Over at
      Mexico, everyone makes homemade tamales. Some people even grow their own
      ingredients to make them. That's how tamales are distributed.
    </p>
    <h1>Body Paragraph three</h1>
    <p>
      <em>Killing animals for food.</em><br>
      In most Latin-American countries, people who live in ranches or in <!--Yeah, the killing part is only for people who lice in ranches or barns or farms...-->
      barns kill animals for food. The animals are usually bought and raised as
      babies. They are killed when they're feasible adults.<!--just the circle of life fam-->
      Here in the U.S., we buy our meat at the store. The people who sell the
      animals to the store are the ones responsible for raising and killing
      the animals. We only have to go buy the food. Basically, we just buy it.
    </p>
    <h1><em>Conclusion</em></h1>
    <p>
      So, everyone has their diffrences, from language, to how food is made and
      obtained. The U.S.'s culture is very different from mine. The U.S. is a
      whole diffrent country.
