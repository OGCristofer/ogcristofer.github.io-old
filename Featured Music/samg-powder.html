      It's just dope. <br>
      This song has a sick 808 bassline, it's made by one of my favorite
      artists, Sam Gellaitry. <b>Featuring some of the best vocals aroun',</b>
      this song is made up of mostly Synthesized, or soft-synth, sounds. Sam is
      the 18 year old guy who will change how we see Chillstep.
