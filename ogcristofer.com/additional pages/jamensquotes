Have you ever randomly thought of a forever looping gif almost
From:

in your head.
From:
Jamen Marz (Ramen)

Of like a weird pattern
From:
Jamen Marz (Ramen)

That morphs, and then loops perfecly.

At first, I was imagining like

vertical stright lines up and down a paper.
From:
Jamen Marz (Ramen)

PArallel

Then they started morphing
Sent on:

then they went everywhere
From:
Jamen Marz (Ramen)

And then, I though about, what if we put a dot somewhere on the canvas.

Are you smoking weed?
Sent on:

7:40 pm
From:
Jamen Marz (Ramen)

Yes.

From:
Jamen Marz (Ramen)

I'm not hallucinating, this is just in my imagination.
From:
Jamen Marz (Ramen)

So, back to the dot.
From:
Jamen Marz (Ramen)

When I put it around the canvas, the lines started bending away from it.

1st of all, pass the blunt. Second of all, the lines are rejecting the dot.

From:
Jamen Marz (Ramen)

The I was thinking about how, the lines can't evenly distribute around the dot because it's in 2nd dismension.
Sent on:

From:
Jamen Marz (Ramen)

So all of the suden, the 2D plain turned into a 3d plain.
From:
Jamen Marz (Ramen)

And the dot became a circle.
From:
Jamen Marz (Ramen)

And I started falling into the lines.
From:
Jamen Marz (Ramen)

And then, I thought about, how if someone were looking down at this.
From:
Jamen Marz (Ramen)

Like a view of the universe, like God or something.
From:
Jamen Marz (Ramen)

They would see the dot in the middle.
From:
Jamen Marz (Ramen)

And through that dot, the colors inverse.
From:
Jamen Marz (Ramen)

Like, through the space that the dot is pushing the lines away, that space inverts the colors.

woah

From:
Jamen Marz (Ramen)

But it was all so fast.

From:
Jamen Marz (Ramen)

Sent on:

6:46 pm
From:
Jamen Marz (Ramen)

How life moves so fast?
From:
Jamen Marz (Ramen)

What if this experience is a metaphor of life.
From:
Jamen Marz (Ramen)

Life is moving so fast.

No, like the fact it all moves so fast
Sent on:

7:48 pm
From:
Jamen Marz (Ramen)

Life is always moving fast.
Sent on:

6:48 pm

It's because of our routines.
Sent on:

7:48 pm
From:
Jamen Marz (Ramen)

Crazy shit happens.


But what is important
From:
Jamen Marz (Ramen)

Is that we have time to stop
From:
Jamen Marz (Ramen)

And paint the memories.


I mean
From:
Jamen Marz (Ramen)

Life is crazy in a beautiful way.
